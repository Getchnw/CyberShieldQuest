    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 24882698215426
    m_Localized: That is the first step... The threat uses a script called an ID
      Enumerator. It runs through IDs (101, 102, 103) continuously, searching for
      vulnerable targets.

      out of an allowed directory and access uncontrolled parent directories \u2014
      like walking backward out of a locked room into a public hallway."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: "It decodes all incoming data back to its true form \u2014 the Canonical
      Form \u2014 before passing it to the filter for inspection. To defeat the Nested

    m_Localized: "To defend against Absolute Path attacks, we use the Root Jail.

      \u2014 never the real system files."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 24882702409738
    m_Localized: And of course, the strongest defense is the Secure Path Validator.

      is secure\u2026 But this time, the alarm is coming from inside our data vault
      itself."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 24882702409779
    m_Localized: Does that mean an intruder is already inside? Are our secrets safe?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 24882702409780
    m_Localized: That is the critical question. This lesson is about Insecure Data
      at Rest. The real test is what an attacker sees after opening our vault.

    m_Localized: When an intruder gains access to the database, a threat known as
      the Database Peeker immediately gets to work.

      m_Items: []

    m_Localized: "If we store sensitive data \u2014 such as passwords \u2014 in plain
      text, it\u2019s like writing all our secrets in an unlocked notebook."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 24882702409783
    m_Localized: What would the Database Peeker do with such an open notebook?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 24882702409784
    m_Localized: "It launches a Database Dump attack \u2014 copying all readable
      sensitive data from the database at once, instantly obtaining every secret."
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 24882702409785
    m_Localized: Then we must never store secrets in plain text! How do we defend
      against this?
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 24882702409786
    m_Localized: We use the Crypto-Forge, known technically as a Secure Hash Protocol.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 24882702409787
    m_Localized: This is a one-way transformation process that crushes plain-text
      passwords into unreadable hash values. Even if an attacker steals the hash,
      they cannot reverse it back into the original password.
    m_Metadata:
      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 24882702409788
    m_Localized: "With this method, even if the Database Peeker performs a dump,
      all they obtain are unreadable hash values \u2014 not the real secrets."
